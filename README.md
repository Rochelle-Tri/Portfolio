# Rochelle Tri's Portfolio for IAT 339

This portfolio was coded by Rochelle with the help of the framework, Bulma: https://bulma.io/

Rochelle used this Bulma template to help her learn and build the portfolio: https://bulmatemplates.github.io/bulma-templates/templates/blog-tailsaw.html
and
Bulma's documentation site for further learning: https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/

All images were made or edited by Rochelle aside from the screenshot from Shopify: https://polaris.shopify.com/foundations/foundations/internationalization

Note: Looks like there are two authors working on this project but it was just me working from my pc at home and my laptop outside of home
